+## Rate of Change
+
+To understand **"Rate of Change"**, let's start with the "q" function, which returns the number of meters traveled by a cyclist based on the number of seconds the cyclist rode the bike.
+
+**Imagine that the function is this:**

+
+## Limit
+
+Imagine that we have a company that produces parts (pe√ßas) *and as it produces, its profit varies (e, √† medida que ela produz, seu lucro varia)*.
+
+![img](images/intro-to-limit-01.png)  
+
+See that:
+
+ - **We have a graph:**
+   - Profit as a function of production (Lucro em fun√ß√£o da produ√ß√£o).
+ - **The "X" axis:**
+   - Represents the "Production".
+ - **The "Y" axis:**
+   - Represents the "Profit".
+   - **NOTE:** Or *loss (prejuizo)*, because it depends on production.
+
+Now imagine that if we didn't produce anything we would have a 10k loss:
+
+![img](images/intro-to-limit-02.png)  
+
+> **Why 10k loss?**  
+> We need to pay rent (aluguel), water, electricity and we don't produce anything, that is, we have made a *loss*.
+
+Now, imagine that we continue *producing* and *collecting data* and we stop at the following graph:
+
+![img](images/intro-to-limit-03.png)  
+
+See that:
+
+ - **The *first* month we produce 5k:**
+   - *We didn't make a profit.*
+   - **NOTE:** That's because with this production our profit was zero after paying for everything.
+ - **The *second* month we produce 7k:**
+   - *We made 50k profit.*
+ - **The *third* month we produce 12k:**
+   - *We made 100k profit.*
+ - **The *fourth* month we produce 15k:**
+   - *We made 70k profit.*
+ - **The *fifth* month we produce 19k:**
+   - *We made 30k profit.*
+
+**NOTE:**  Now, if we pay attention:
+
+ - **The *second* month we produce 7k:**
+   - *We made 50k profit.*
+ - **The *fifth* month we produce 19k:**
+   - *We made 30k profit.*
+
+> **What?**  
+> How can we produce more than twice as much and make less profit?
+
+Even worse (Pior ainda):
+
+ - **The *third* month we produce 12k:**
+   - *We made 100k profit.*
+ - **The *fifth* month we produce 19k:**
+   - *We made 30k profit.*
+
+> **What the hell is this?**  
+> There must be someone stealing from the company! (S√≥ pode ter algu√©m roubando na empresa!)
+
+Now imagine that we hired (contratamos) a company to analyze this and they say *we are not being robbed (n√£o estamos sendo roubados)*.
+
+> **What? Like this? (Como assim?)**  
+
+Let's recap everything:
+
+ - **The *first* month we produce 5k:**
+   - *We didn't make a profit.*
+   - **NOTE:** That's because with this production our profit was zero after paying for everything.
+ - **The *second* month we produce 7k:**
+   - *We made 50k profit.*
+ - **The *third* month we produce 12k:**
+   - *We made 100k profit.*
+
+> **So far so good (Ate aqui tudo bem)...**
+
+The problem is that from now on (producing 12k pieces per month) the more your production increases, the more your profit will no longer increase and may even decrease.
+
+> **Why would that be? (Por que ser√°?)**
+
+ - **Machines may be working too hard:**
+   - And this can cause them to break down and this reduces the company's profit because you have to get them fixed.
+ - **Employees may be overworked:**
+   - They may have filed a lawsuit against you that you lost and had to pay.
+   - **NOTE:** This also reduces the company's profits.
+
+> **NOTE:**  
+In other words, in our company's scenario today, with this number of employees and number of machines, there is a **"maximum (limit)"** for profit.
+
+That is, we need to *find* out:
+
+ - The minimum we need to produce.
+   - *Less effort.*
+ - To make the **maximum (limit)** profit possible.
+   - *Biggest gain.*
+
+> In other words, we are interested in the maximum (limit) possible profit with the least *effort (production)*.
+
+Back to our example (graph): We know the *maximum point (limit)* but imagine that we don't know the *maximum point (limit)* of this function.
+
+> **In other words, what is the minimum we need to produce to make the maximum profit possible?**
+
+![img](images/intro-to-limit-04.png)  
+
+To find this value we need the *"derivative"* of our function:
