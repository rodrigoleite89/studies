## Intro to Non-Linear Data Structures

 - A Non-Linear Data Structure has no set sequence of connecting all its elements;
 - Each element can have multiple paths to connect to other elements;
 - Such (essas) data structures supports multi-level storage;
 - Often cannot be traversed in single run;
 - Such (essas) data structures are not easy to implement but are more efficient in utilizing computer memory.

**NOTE:**  
Examples of **Non-Linear Data Structures** are:

 - Graphs;
 - Tree

## Difference between Linear and Non-linear Data Structures

Following are the important differences between **Linear Data Structures** and **Non-linear Data Structures**:

| Key                           | Linear Data Structures | Non-linear Data Structures |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Data Element Arrangement**  | In Linear Data Structure, data elements are sequentially connected and each element is traversable through a single run. | In Non-Linear Data Structure, data elements are hierarchically connected and are present at various levels. |
| **Levels**                    | In Linear Data Structure, all data elements are present at a single level. | In Non-Linear Data Structure, data elements are present at multiple levels. |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Linear Data Structures are easier to implement. | Non-Linear Data Structures are difficult to understand and implement as compared to Linear Data Structures. |
| **Traversal**                 | Linear Data Structures can be traversed completely in a single run. | Non-Linear Data Structures are not easy to traverse and needs multiple runs to be traversed completely. |
| **Memory Utilization**        | Linear Data Structures are not very memory friendly and are not utilizing memory efficiently. | Non-Linear Data Structures uses memory very efficiently. |
| **Time Complexity**           | The *time complexity* of Linear Data Structure often increases when data increase in size. | The time complexity of Non-Linear data Structure `often remains (geralmente permanece)` when data increase in size. |
| **Examples**                  | Array, Matrix, List (Linked-List), Stack, Queue. | Graph, Tree, Map |
