## "Node" class representation for a Singly Linked List

> A **Linked List** is composed of connected **"Nodes"**, where each **"Node"** has:

 - **"Data"** stored.
 - And a pointer **"next"** to the next *Node*.

![img](images/linked-list-single-in-c.png)  

For example, see how represents a **"Node"** data structure *class*:

**C++:** [Node.h](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/Node.h)
```cpp
#ifndef NODE_H_
#define NODE_H_

class Node
{
public:
    int data;
    Node *next;

    Node(int data); // Constructor prototype.
};

#endif // NODE_H_
```

**C++:** [Node.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/Node.cpp)
```cpp
#include "Node.h"

// Constructor implementation (definition).
Node::Node(int data)
{
    this->data = data;
    this->next = nullptr;
}
```

**Python:** [Node.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/Node.py)
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
```

<div id="ll-class-for-sll"></div>

## "SinglyLinkedList" class representation

Now, let's see how to implement a **Singly Linked List** *class*:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.h](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.h)
```cpp
#ifndef LINKEDLIST_H_
#define LINKEDLIST_H_

#include "Node.h"

class SinglyLinkedList
{
public:
    Node *head;

    SinglyLinkedList();
};

#endif // LINKEDLIST_H_
```

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"

// Constructor implementation (definition).
SinglyLinkedList::SinglyLinkedList()
{
    this->head = nullptr;
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
from Node import Node


class SinglyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

<div id="calnmuonc"></div>

## Creating and Linking Nodes manually using only "Node" class (Using pointers)

> One approach to create a Nodes is create a pointer to each new Node and link them manually.

**Using this approach first, we need to create a pointer for each new Node:**

**C++:**
```cpp
// Node pointers
Node *head   = nullptr;
Node *second = nullptr;
Node *third  = nullptr;
```

**Python:**
```python
# Node pointers
head   = None
second = None
third  = None
```

**Allocate Nodes in the Heap. That's, allocate the memory to the new Nodes:**

   - We can use the constructor of the Node to assign the data here:
   - Or assign data next using *"-> (. in Python)"* operator:

**C++:**
```cpp
// Assign data using constructor.
head   = new Node(10);
second = new Node(20);
third  = new Node(30);

// Assign data using "->" operator.
head->data   = 10;
second->data = 20;
third->data  = 30;
```

**Python:**
```python
# Assign data using constructor.
head   = Node(10)
second = Node(20)
third  = Node(30)

# Assign data using "." operator.
head.data   = 10
second.data = 20
third.data  = 30
```

**Finally, we need to link the Nodes:**

 - The current Node pointer must have (deve ter) the memory address of the next Node saved in your "next" pointer.
 - The last Node (tail) must have (deve ter) "next" pointer as NULL (nullptr).

**C++:**
```cpp
head->next   = second;  // Link first (head) node with second.
second->next = third;   // Link second node with the third.
third->next  = nullptr; // Set last Node (tail) as NULL.
```

**Python:**
```python
head.next   = second   # Link first (head) node with second.
second.next = third    # Link second node with the third.
third.next  = None     # Set last Node (tail) as NULL.
```

Let's, test it in practice:

**C++:** [driver_insert_using_node_class.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_insert_using_node_class.cpp)
```cpp
#include "Node.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // Node pointers
    Node *head   = nullptr;
    Node *second = nullptr;
    Node *third  = nullptr;

    // Assign data using constructor.
    head   = new Node(10);
    second = new Node(20);
    third  = new Node(30);

    // Assign data using "->" operator.
    // head->data   = 10;
    // second->data = 20;
    // third->data  = 30;

    head->next   = second;  // Link first (head) node with second.
    second->next = third;   // Link second node with the third.
    third->next  = nullptr; // Set last Node (tail) as NULL.

    std::cout << "Value in the First Node (head): " << head->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Value in the Second Node: " << second->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Value in the Third Node (tail): " << third->data << "\n";

    return 0;
}

```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp driver_insert_using_node_class.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Value in the First Node (head): 10
Value in the Second Node: 20
Value in the Third Node (tail): 30
```

**Python:** [driver_insert_using_node_class.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_insert_using_node_class.py)
```bash
from Node import Node

# Node pointers
head   = None
second = None
third  = None

# Assign data using constructor.
head = Node(10)
second = Node(20)
third = Node(30)

# Assign data using "." operator.
# head.data   = 10
# second.data = 20
# third.data  = 30

head.next   = second   # Link first (head) node with second.
second.next = third    # Link second node with the third.
third.next  = None     # Set last Node (tail) as NULL.

print(f"Value in the First Node (head): {head.data}")
print(f"Value in the Second Node: {second.data}")
print(f"Value in the Third Node (tail): {third.data}")
```

**INPUT:**  
```bash
python driver_insert_using_node_class.py 
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Value in the First Node (head): 10
Value in the Second Node: 20
Value in the Third Node (tail): 30
```

<div id="cnulcuhnrp"></div>

## Creating Nodes using "SinglyLinkedList" class (Using "head.next" reference/pointer)

> Another approach to create a new "Node" is use "next" pointer of the **"head Node"** of **SinglyLinkedList** class to create other Nodes.

**First, we need to create an instance (variable) of the SinglyLinkedList class:**

**C++:**
```cpp
SinglyLinkedList sll;
```

**Python:**
```python
sll = SinglyLinkedList()
```

**Now, we can use the "head Node" (Initialized as NULL by default in the constructor) to create other Nodes:**

   - We can use the constructor of the Node to assign the data here:
   - Or assign data next using *"-> (. in Python)"* operator:

**C++:**
```cpp
// Assign data using constructor.
sll.head = new Node(10);             // 10
sll.head->next = new Node(20);       // 10->20
sll.head->next->next = new Node(30); // 10->20->30

// Assign data using "->" operator.
sll.head->data              = 10; // 10
sll.head->next->data        = 20; // 10->20
sll.head->next->next->data  = 30; // 10->20->30
```

**Python:**
```python
# Assign data using constructor.
sll.head = Node(10)            # 10
sll.head.next = Node(20)       # 10->20
sll.head.next.next = Node(30)  # 10->20->30

# Assign data using "." operator.
sll.head.data = 1            # 10
sll.head.next.data = 2       # 10->20
sll.head.next.next.data = 3  # 10->20->30
```

Let's, test it in practice:

**C++:** [driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    SinglyLinkedList sll;

    // Assign data using constructor.
    sll.head = new Node(10);
    sll.head->next = new Node(20);
    sll.head->next->next = new Node(30);

    // Assign data using "->" operator.
    // sll.head->data              = 10;
    // sll.head->next->data        = 20;
    // sll.head->next->next->data  = 30;

    std::cout << "Value in the First Node (head): " << sll.head->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Value in the Second Node: " << sll.head->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Value in the Third Node (tail): " << sll.head->next->next->data << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Value in the First Node (head): 10
Value in the Second Node: 20
Value in the Third Node (tail): 30
```

**Python:** [driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.py)
```python
from SinglyLinkedList import SinglyLinkedList
from Node import Node

sll = SinglyLinkedList()

# Assign data using constructor.
sll.head = Node(10)
sll.head.next = Node(20)
sll.head.next.next = Node(30)

# Assign data using "." operator.
# sll.head.data = 1
# sll.head.next.data = 2
# sll.head.next.next.data = 3

print("Value in the First Node (head):", sll.head.data)
print("Value in the Second Node:", sll.head.next.data)
print("Value in the Third Node (tail):", sll.head.next.next.data)
```

> **NOTE:**  
> - However, here we need to use the Node() class to reference a Node in a SinglyLinkedList class.
> - This is because we don't have a function to do it.

**INTPUT:**  
```bash
python driver_insert_using_SinglyLinkedList_class.py
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Value in the First Node (head): 10
Value in the Second Node: 20
Value in the Third Node (tail): 30
```

<div id="inserting-push-sll"></div>

## Add a new Node at the front (push) | O(1)

> Now let's, see how to insert a new Node in the **front of a Singly Linked List (Also called push)**.

For example, imagine we have the following **Singly Linked List**:

```
10->15->20->25
```

If we add item (element) **5** at the *front*, then the **Singly Linked List** becomes:

```
5->10->15->20->25
```

To understand more easily see the image below:

![img](images/sll-push-01.png)  

To apply these mechanics we need to:

 1. Allocate a new Node:
   1.1. Here, we can assign data.
 2. Make "next" of the "new_node" point to head (old first Node).
 3. Move the head to point to the "new_node".

Now, let's see how to implement the **push()** function:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```cpp
void SinglyLinkedList::push(int data)
{
    Node *new_node = new Node(data);
    new_node->next = (this->head);
    this->head = new_node;
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
def push(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```

> **Is this function work in an Empty List?**  
> Yes!


The **Time** and **Space complexity** of the **push()** function is:

 - **Time Complexity:**
   - **[Worst Case] - Big O(O)** 
     - **O(1):** The time complexity of this function in the *worst case* is **O(1)**, which means it is constant. This is because the insertion always occurs at the beginning of the list, regardless (sem considerar) of the size of the list. No matter (não importa) how many elements the list already contains, the function performs a fixed number of operations.
   - **[Best Case] - Omega (Ω)**
     - **Ω(1):** The time complexity of this function in the *best case* is **O(1)**, which means it is constant. This is because the insertion always occurs at the beginning of the list, regardless (sem considerar) of the size of the list.
   - **[Average Case] - Theta (Θ)**
     - **Θ(1):** In the *average case*, the time complexity of the push function is **O(1)**, which means it is constant. This is because the function always inserts the new node at the beginning of the linked list, regardless (sem considerar) of the size of the list.
     - Regardless (Independentemente) of the number of elements already present in the list, the function performs a fixed number of operations to carry out the insertion. Therefore, the time complexity remains constant in the average case.
 - **Space Complexity:**
   - **(1):** The space complexity of this function is **constant (1)**, regardless (Independentemente) of the case *(worst, best, or average)*. This is because the amount of space required to execute the function does not depend on the size of the input data but only on the creation of a new node.

Finally, let's test the function **push()** in practice:

**C++:** [driver_push.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_push.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    SinglyLinkedList sll;

    /**
     * Remember, we are using the push() approach, that's,
     * the new Node is added in the front of the Singly Linked List.
    */
    sll.push(25); // 25(head)
    sll.push(20); // 20(head)->25
    sll.push(15); // 15(head)->20->25
    sll.push(10); // 10(head)->15->20->25
    sll.push(5);  // 5 (head)->10->15->20->25

    std::cout << "Data in the first (head) Node: " << sll.head->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the second Node: " << sll.head->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the third Node: " << sll.head->next->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the four Node: " << sll.head->next->next->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the fifth Node: " << sll.head->next->next->next->next->data << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_push.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Data in the first (head) Node: 5
Data in the second Node: 10
Data in the third Node: 15
Data in the four Node: 20
Data in the fifth Node: 25
```

**Python:** [driver_push.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_push.py)
```python
from SinglyLinkedList import SinglyLinkedList

sll = SinglyLinkedList()

# Remember, we are using the push() approach, that's,
# the new Node is added in the front of the Singly Linked List.
sll.push(25); # 25(head)
sll.push(20); # 20(head)->25
sll.push(15); # 15(head)->20->25
sll.push(10); # 10(head)->15->20->25
sll.push(5);  # 5 (head)->10->15->20->25

print("Data in the first (head) Node:", sll.head.data)
print("Data in the second Node:", sll.head.next.data)
print("Data in the third Node:", sll.head.next.next.data)
print("Data in the four Node:", sll.head.next.next.next.data)
print("Data in the fifth Node:", sll.head.next.next.next.next.data)
```

**INTPUT:**  
```bash
python driver_push.py
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash

Data in the second Node: 10
Data in the third Node: 15

```

<div id="inserting-insertafterpassed-node-sll"></div>

## Add a new Node after a passed Node (insertAfterPassedNode) | O(1)

> Now let's, see how to insert a new Node after a passed Node in a **Singly Linked List**.

For example, see the image below:

![img](images/insertafternoden-01.png)  

**The first, thing we need to do is check if the passed Node is NULL (None):**

**C++:**
```cpp
if (passed_node == NULL)
{
    std::cout << "The passed Node cannot be NULL!";
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if passed_node is None:
    print("The passed Node cannot be NULL!")
    return
```

**Now, we need to create a new Node and link (connect) the Nodes:**

 - Create a "new_node".
 - Next, set the "next" point of the "new_node" to point to "next" of the passed Node.
 - Finally, set the "next" point of the passed Node to point to the "new_node".

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *new_node = new Node(data);
new_node->next = passed_node->next;
passed_node->next = new_node;
```

**Python:**
```python
new_node = Node(data)
new_node.next = passed_node.next
passed_node.next = new_node
```

See, the complete code to **insertAfterPassedNode()** function below:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```python
void SinglyLinkedList::insertAfterPassedNode(Node *passed_node, int data)
{
    if (passed_node == NULL)
    {
        std::cout << "The passed Node cannot be NULL!";
        return;
    }
    Node *new_node = new Node(data);
    new_node->next = passed_node->next;
    passed_node->next = new_node;
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
def insertAfterPassedNode(self, passed_node, data):
    if passed_node is None:
        print("The passed Node cannot be NULL!")
        return
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = passed_node.next
    passed_node.next = new_node
```

The **Time** and **Space complexity** of the **insertAfterPassedNode()** function is:

 - **Time Complexity:**
   - **[Worst Case] - Big O(O)** 
     - **O(1):** The time complexity of this function in the *worst case* is **O(1)**. This is because the function performs a fixed number of operations, regardless of the size of the node list.
   - **[Best Case] - Omega (Ω)**
     - **Ω(1):** The time complexity of this function in the *best case* is also **O(1)**. This is because even in the best case, where the function doesn't need to print the error message and can proceed normally, it performs a fixed number of operations. 
   - **[Average Case] - Theta (Θ)**
     - **Θ(1):** The time complexity of the function in the *average case* is also **O(1)**, which means it has constant complexity.
 - **Space Complexity:**
   - **(1):** The space complexity of the function is constant in all cases because it does not use any additional data structure that grows with the input size. It only creates a new node and updates the references of the existing nodes.

Finally, let's test the **insertAfterPassedNode()** function in practice:

**C++:** [driver_insertAfterNodeN.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_insertAfterNodeN.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    SinglyLinkedList sll;

    sll.head = new Node(5);                    // 5(head)
    sll.head->next = new Node(10);             // 5(head)->10
    sll.head->next->next = new Node(20);       // 5(head)->10->20
    sll.head->next->next->next = new Node(25); // 5(head)->10->20->25

    std::cout << "Singlye Linked List before insert the new Node:" << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the first (head) Node: " << sll.head->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the second Node: " << sll.head->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the third Node: " << sll.head->next->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the four Node: " << sll.head->next->next->next->data << "\n";

    sll.insertAfterNodeN(sll.head->next, 15); // 5(head)->10(prev_node)->new_node(15)->20->25

    std::cout << "\nSinglye Linked List after insert the new Node:" << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the first (head) Node: " << sll.head->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the second Node: " << sll.head->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the third Node: " << sll.head->next->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the four Node: " << sll.head->next->next->next->data << "\n";
    std::cout << "Data in the fifth Node: " << sll.head->next->next->next->next->data << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_insertAfterNodeN.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash

## Add a new Node at the end (append) | O(n)

> Now let's, see how to inser a new Node **at the end given Singly Linked List (Also called append)**.

For example, imagine we have the following **Singly Linked List**:

```
5->10->15->20
```

And we add item (element) **25** at the end, then the **Singly Linked List** becomes:

```
5->10->15->20->25
```

See the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/ssl-insert-append-01.png)  

**To apply this first, we need to allocate memory to the "new_node":**

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *new_node = new Node(data);
```

**Python:**
```python
new_node = Node(data)
```

**How the "new_node" will always be the last (tail) we need to set the "next" pointer as NULL (None):**

**C++:**
```cpp
new_node->next = NULL;
```

**Python:**
```python
new_node.next = None
```

**Now, we need to check if the Linked List is empty, this is because if the Singly Linked List is empty, then we need to make the "new_node" as head and stop the method (return):**

**C++:**
```cpp
if (this->head == NULL)
{
    this->head = new_node;
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if self.head is None:
    self.head = new_node
    return
```

**Now, we need to find the last Node. For it, let's create a "temp_node" to loop until the last Node:**

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *temp_node = this->head;
while (temp_node->next != NULL)
{
    temp_node = temp_node->next;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
temp_node = self.head
while temp_node.next is not None:
    temp_node = temp_node.next
```

**With the old last Node saved in "temp_node", now we need to set him to point to the "new_node" (new last Node):**

**C++:**
```cpp
temp_node->next = new_node;
```

**Python:**
```python
temp_node.next = new_node
```

See, the complete code to **append()** function below:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```cpp
void SinglyLinkedList::append(int data)
{
    Node *new_node = new Node(data);
    new_node->next = NULL;

    if (this->head == NULL)
    {
        this->head = new_node;
        return; // Stop the method.
    }
    else
    {
        Node *temp_node = this->head;
        while (temp_node->next != NULL)
        {
            temp_node = temp_node->next;
        }
        temp_node->next = new_node;
    }
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
def append(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = None
    if self.head is None:
        self.head = new_node
        return
    else:
        temp_node = self.head
        while temp_node.next is not None:
            temp_node = temp_node.next
        temp_node.next = new_node
```

The **Time** and **Space complexity** of the **append()** function is:

 - **Time Complexity:**
   - **[Worst Case] - Big O(O)** 
     - **O(n):** The time complexity of this function in the *worst case* is **O(n)**, where *"n"* is the number of elements in the linked list.
   - **[Best Case] - Omega (Ω)**
     - **Ω(1):** The *"append"* function has a special best case when the linked list is empty. In this case, the time complexity is **O(1)**, which is constant.
   - **[Average Case] - Theta (Θ)**
     - **Θ(n):** In the *average case*, the function will traverse the list using the "while" loop until it finds the last node. This involves visiting each node sequentially until reaching the last node. The number of iterations required will depend on the average size of the list, resulting in a time complexity proportional to the average number of elements in the list, which is **O(n)**, where *"n"* is the average number of elements.
 - **Space Complexity:**
   - **(1):** The space complexity of the *"append"* function is the same in all cases: *worst case*, *best case*, and *average case*. It is **O(1)**, which means it is constant. The function uses a constant amount of additional space, regardless of the size of the linked list. It only creates a new temporary node to store the data and then performs manipulations on the existing pointers of the list, without the need to allocate additional space to store the entire list.

Finally, let's test the **append()** function in practice:

**C++:** [driver_append.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_append.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{

    std::cout << "List1 = 5->10->15->20->25 + append(30):\n";
    SinglyLinkedList list1;
    list1.head = new Node(5);
    list1.head->next = new Node(10);
    list1.head->next->next = new Node(15);
    list1.head->next->next->next = new Node(20);
    list1.head->next->next->next->next = new Node(25);
    list1.append(30);
    list1.printListFromHead(); // Print new Node value.

    std::cout << "\nList2 = append(30): \n";
    SinglyLinkedList list2;
    list2.append(30);
    list2.printListFromHead(); // Print new Node value.

    std::cout << "\nList3 = append(1) + append(2) + append(3): \n";
    SinglyLinkedList list3;
    list3.append(1);
    list3.append(2);
    list3.append(3);
    list3.printListFromHead();

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_append.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
List1 = 5->10->15->20->25 + append(30):
5 10 15 20 25 30

List2 = append(30): 
30

List3 = append(1) + append(2) + append(3): 
1 2 3
```

**Python:** [driver_append.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_append.py)
```python
from SinglyLinkedList import SinglyLinkedList
from Node import Node

print("List1 = 5->10->15->20->25 + append(30):")
List1 = SinglyLinkedList()
List1.head = Node(5)
List1.head.next = Node(10)
List1.head.next.next = Node(15)
List1.head.next.next.next = Node(20)
List1.head.next.next.next.next = Node(25)
List1.append(30)
List1.printListFromHead()

print("\nList2 = append(30):")
List2 = SinglyLinkedList()
List2.append(30)
List2.printListFromHead()

print("\nList3 = append(1) + append(2) + append(3):")
list3 = SinglyLinkedList()
list3.append(1)
list3.append(2)
list3.append(3)
list3.printListFromHead()

```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
python driver_append.py
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
List1 = 5->10->15->20->25 + append(30):

List2 = append(30):
30 

List3 = append(1) + append(2) + append(3):

<!--- ( Singly Linked List/Deleting a Node in a Singly Linked List ) --->

---

<div id="delete-node-given-position"></div>

## Delete a Singly Linked List node at a given position | O(n)

Here, let's see how to delete a Node in a **Singly Linked List** given position. For example, imagine we have the following **Singly Linked List**:

```
5->10->15->20
```

Now, suppose we need delete the Node in **posiiton 2**:

```
5->10->20
```

> **NOTE:**  
> Like Arrays, Linked Lists same start from the index 0. That's why (por isso) Node(3) was deleted.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/sll-delete-given-position-01.png)

**First, we need check if the Singly Linked List is empty. If the Singly Linked List is empty, then stop the function:**

**C++:**
```cpp
if (this->head == nullptr)
{
    std::cout << "List is empty!\n";
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if self.head is None:
    print("List is empty!")
    return
```

**Next, we need to create a "temp_node" (useful Node) to loop by the Nodes:**

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *temp_node = this->head;
```

**Python:**
```python
temp = self.head
```

**If the position (n) is zero (0), then the head will be deleted:**

 - But, before we need to do the second Node as the new head:
   - `this->head = temp_node->next;`.
   - `self.head = temp.next`.
 - Now, we can dele the old head:
   - `free(temp_node); `.
   - `del temp`.

**C++:**
```cpp
if (position == 0)
{
    this->head = temp_node->next;
    free(temp_node);
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if position == 0:
    self.head = temp.next
    del temp
    return
```

**Now, let's make "temp_node" point to the previous Node that will be deleted (to understand how to do that, see the example below):**

```cpp
/**
 * [Finds the "Node" before the "Node" (position) to be deleted]
 * Check in all iterations if the de Node (starting from temp=head)
 * is NULL and "i < position -1", that's, the Node before the "Node"
 * (position) to be deleted.
 *
 * For example, imagine we have the following list: 8->2->3->1->7->NULL
 * - temp = head (zero 0) = [8]->2->3->1->7->NULL
 * - Imagine that passed position was: 4
 *
 * First iteration: i=0 < (position=4 - 1) = 3 | YES!
 * Pass (loop) to the next node (temp = temp->next) = 8->[2]->3->1->7->NULL
 *
 * Second iteration: i++, i=1 < (position=4 - 1) = 3 | YES!
 * Pass (loop) to the next node (temp = temp->next) = 8->2->[3]->1->7->NULL
 *
 * Third iteration: i++, i=2 < (position=4 - 1) = 3 | YES!
 * Pass (loop) to the next node (temp = temp->next) =  8->2->3->[1]->7->NULL
 *
 * Fourth iteration: i++, i=3 < (position=4 - 1) = 3 | NO!
 * Now, the internal statements in the loop "for" not is executed!
 *
 * Ok, we have the "Node" before the "Node" that will be deleted
 * saved in the "temp_node" pointer: 8->2->3->[1]->7->NULL
 *
 * [Another example was if the "position" was 1:]
 * First iteration: i=0 < (position=1 - 1) = 0 | NO!
 * That's, temp = [8]->2->3->1->7->NULL, a "Node" before the
 * Node" that will be deleted saved in the "temp" pointer.
 */
```

**The loop to make it:**

**C++:**
```cpp
for (int i = 0; temp_node != NULL && i < position - 1; i++)
    temp_node = temp_node->next;
```

**Python:**
```python
for i in range(position - 1):
    if temp_node is None:
        break
    temp_node = temp_node.next
```

**We also need to check if  the passed position is more than number of nodes:**

**C++:**
```cpp
if (temp_node == NULL || temp_node->next == NULL)
{
    std::cout << "The Node position exceeded!\n";
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if temp_node is None or temp_node.next is None:
    print("The Node position exceeded!")
    return
```

**Now, we need to save the "next (memory address of the next node)" of the Node will be deleted (to understand how to do that, see the example below):**

```cpp
/**
 * As the "temp->next" is the Node that will be deleted, we need to save
 * the "next" of the Node that will be deleted in some pointer (next).
 *
 * For example, position=1:
 *
 *  next   =   temp -> next -> next
 *              [8] ->  2   ->   3   ->1->7->NULL
 *                      |        |
 *                      |        ---(Node will be save in "next" pointer)
 *                      |
 *            (Node will be deleted)
 */
```

**The code to make it:**

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *next = temp_node->next->next;
```

**Python:**
```python
next = temp_node.next.next
```

**Now, let's delete the Node in the position (Free memory) passed:**

**Example:**
```cpp
/**
 * Delete the Node in the position passed, "temp->next":
 *
 *  next   =   temp ->        -> next
 *              [8] ->        ->   3   ->1->7->NULL
 *                                 |
 *                                 ---(Node will be save in "next" pointer)
 */
```

**The code to make it:**

**C++:**
```cpp
free(temp_node->next);
```

**Python:**
```python
del temp_node.next
```

**Finally, let's link the unlinked Nodes (to understand how to do that, see the example below):**

```cpp
/**
 * Make the "Node" before the "Node" that was deleted point
 * to the "Node" after the "Node" that was deleted.
 *
 *    [8]->3->1->7->NULL
 *     |   |
 *     |   ---------
 *     |           |
 * temp->next = next
 */
```

**The code to make it:**

**C++:**
```cpp
temp_node->next = next;
```

**Python:**
```python
temp_node.next = next
```

See, the complete code to **deleteNodeN()** function below:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```cpp
void SinglyLinkedList::deleteNodeN(int position)
{
    if (this->head == nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "List is empty!\n";
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        Node *temp_node = this->head;
        if (position == 0)
        {
            this->head = temp_node->next;
            free(temp_node);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = 0; temp_node != NULL && i < position - 1; i++)
            temp_node = temp_node->next;
        if (temp_node == NULL || temp_node->next == NULL)
        {
            std::cout << "The Node position exceeded!\n";
            return;
        }
        Node *next = temp_node->next->next;
        free(temp_node->next);
        temp_node->next = next;
    }
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
def deleteNodeN(self, position):
    if self.head is None:
        print("List is empty!")
        return
    else:
        temp_node = self.head
        if position == 0:
            self.head = temp_node.next
            del temp_node
            return
        for i in range(position - 1):
            if temp_node is None:
                break
            temp_node = temp_node.next
        if temp_node is None or temp_node.next is None:
            print("The Node position exceeded!")
            return
        next = temp_node.next.next
        del temp_node.next
        temp_node.next = next
```

The **Time** and **Space complexity** of the **deleteNodeN()** function is:

 - **Time Complexity:**
   - **[Worst Case] - Big O(O)** 
     - **O(n):** If the position is not *"zero 0"*, and the list is no empty, the function traverses the nodes in the list until it finds the node before the one to be deleted. This involves a loop that traverses, at most, *n-1 nodes*, where *"n"* is the total number of nodes in the list. Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)** in the *Worst Case*.
   - **[Best Case] - Omega (Ω)**
     - **Ω(1):** If the list is empty (i.e., head is nullptr), the function prints *"List is empty!"* and returns immediately. This requires only one operation, so the time complexity is **O(1)**.
     - **Ω(1):** If the list is not empty, but the node to be deleted is at the beginning of the list (i.e., the position is zero "0"), the function updates the head pointer to the next node and frees the memory of the deleted node. These operations require a fixed number of operations regardless of the list size, so the time complexity is also **O(1)**.
   - **[Average Case] - Theta (Θ)**
     - **Θ(n):**Considering that the positions of the nodes to be deleted are equally likely and there is no special distribution, the average time complexity will be the same as the *worst case*, which is **O(n)**.
 - **Space Complexity:**
   - **(1):** The Space Complexity in all cases is constant.

Finally, let's test the **deleteNodeN()** function in practice:

**C++:** [driver_deleteNodeN.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_deleteNodeN.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    SinglyLinkedList list;

    std::cout << "Try delete a Node 'n' in an Empty List:\n";
    list.deleteNodeN(0);

    std::cout << "\nList = 8->2->3->1->7:\n";
    list.append(8);
    list.append(2);
    list.append(3);
    list.append(1);
    list.append(7);
    list.printListFromHead(); // Print Nodes values.

    std::cout << "\nList = (8->2->3->1->7) + deleteNodeN(4):\n";
    list.deleteNodeN(4);
    list.printListFromHead(); // Print Nodes values after delete Node position 1.

    std::cout << "\nTry to delete a Node 'n' that position is more than the number of nodes:\n";
    list.deleteNodeN(4);

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_deleteNodeN.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
Try delete a Node 'n' in an Empty List:

List = 8->2->3->1->7:
8 2 3 1 7 

List = (8->2->3->1->7) + deleteNodeN(1):
8 2 3 1 

Try to delete a Node 'n' that position is more than the number of nodes:
The Node position exceeded!
```

**Python:** [driver_deleteNodeN.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_deleteNodeN.py)
```python
from SinglyLinkedList import SinglyLinkedList

if __name__ == '__main__':
    list = SinglyLinkedList()

    print("Try delete a Node 'n' in an Empty List:")
    list.deleteNodeN(0)

    print("\nList = 8->2->3->1->7:")
    list.append(8)
    list.append(2)
    list.append(3)
    list.append(1)
    list.append(7)
    list.printListFromHead() # Print Nodes values.

    print("\nList = (8->2->3->1->7) + deleteNodeN(4):")
    list.deleteNodeN(4)
    list.printListFromHead() # Print Nodes values after delete Node position 1.

    print("\nTry to delete a Node 'n' that position is more than the number of nodes:")
    list.deleteNodeN(4)
```

**INTPUT:**

<div id="traversing-sll-from-the-head"></div>

## Traversing in SinglyLinkedList from the Head until Tail | O(n)

> An approach to **traverse a Singly Linked List** is to start from the Head until the last Node (Tail).

**First, wee need to check if the list is empty:**

**C++:**
```cpp
if (this->head == nullptr)
{
    std::cout << "List is empty!\n";
    return;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
if self.head is None:
    print("List is empty!")
    return
```

**Now, let's create a temporary Node to loop until de last Node printing your values:**

**C++:**
```cpp
Node *current_node = this->head;
```

**Python:**
```python
current_node = self.head
```

**Finally, let's create a loop to iterate by all Nodes printing your values:**

**C++:**
```cpp
while (current_node != NULL)
{
    std::cout << current_node->data << " ";
    current_node = current_node->next;
}
```

**Python:**
```python
while current_node is not None:
    print(current_node.data, end=" ")
    current_node = current_node.next
```

See, the complete code to **printListFromHead()** function below:

**C++:** [SinglyLinkedList.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.cpp)
```cpp
void SinglyLinkedList::printListFromHead()
{
    if (this->head == nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "List is empty!\n";
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        Node *current_node = this->head;
        while (current_node != NULL)
        {
            std::cout << current_node->data << " ";
            current_node = current_node->next;
        }
    }
}
```

**Python:** [SinglyLinkedList.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/SinglyLinkedList.py)
```python
def printListFromHead(self):
    if self.head is None:
        print("List is empty!")
        return
    else:
        current_node = self.head
        while current_node is not None:
            print(current_node.data, end=" ")
            current_node = current_node.next
```

The **Time** and **Space complexity** of the **printListFromHead()** function is:

 - **Time Complexity:**
   - **[Worst Case] - Big O(O)** 
     - **O(n):** The *worst case* time complexity occurs when the list is fully populated, and we need to traverse all nodes to print their values. In this case, the complexity will be **O(n)**, where **"n"** is the number of elements in the list. This happens because the function needs to traverse all the nodes in the list once.
   - **[Best Case] - Omega (Ω)**
     - **Ω(1):** A possible *best case* occurs when the list is empty, meaning there are no nodes in the list. In this case, the complexity will be **O(1)** because the function quickly checks if the list is empty and then returns immediately.
     - **Ω(1):** Another possible *best case* occurs when the list has only one node. The function checks if the list is empty (which it is not), prints the single element, and returns immediately. This operation is performed in constant time, so the time complexity is **O(1)**.
   - **[Average Case] - Theta (Θ)**
     - **Θ(n):** In the *average case*, the time complexity will depend on the distribution of elements in the list. If we assume a random distribution of elements, the complexity will be **O(n)**, where **"n"** is the number of elements in the list. This happens because the function needs to traverse all the nodes in the list once.
 - **Space Complexity:**
   - **(1):** In the *worst case*, *best case*, and *average case*, the function doesn't require any additional space beyond what is already occupied by the linked list. It uses only one variable to track the "current_node", regardless of the size of the list. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, **O(1)**.

Finally, let's test the **printListFromHead()** function in practice:

**C++:** [driver_printListFromHead.cpp](src/cpp/singly-linked-list/driver_printListFromHead.cpp)
```cpp
#include "SinglyLinkedList.h"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    SinglyLinkedList list;
    list.printListFromHead();

    list.head = new Node(10);
    list.printListFromHead();

    list.head->next = new Node(20);
    list.printListFromHead();

    list.head->next->next = new Node(30);
    list.printListFromHead();

    return 0;
}
```

**COMPILATION AND RUN:**
```bash
g++ Node.cpp SinglyLinkedList.cpp driver_printListFromHead.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

**OUTPUT:**  
```bash
List is empty!
10 
10 20 
10 20 30
```

**Python:** [driver_printListFromHead.py](src/python/singly-linked-list/driver_printListFromHead.py)
```python
from SinglyLinkedList import SinglyLinkedList
from Node import Node

print("####### ( Print values from the 'head' until 'tail' ) ######")

sll = SinglyLinkedList()

sll.printListFromHead()

sll.head = Node(40)
sll.printListFromHead()

sll.head.next = Node(50)
sll.printListFromHead()

sll.head.next.next = Node(60)
sll.printListFromHead()
```

**INPUT:** 
```bash
python driver_printListFromHead.py 
```

**OUTPUT:** 
```bash
####### ( Print Node values from the 'head' until 'tail' ) ######
List is empty!
40 
40 50 
40 50 60
```

## "Node" class representation for a Doubly Linked List

> A **Doubly Linked List** is composed of connected **"Nodes"**, where each **"Node"** has:

 - **"Data"** stored.
 - A pointer **"prev"** to the previous *Node*.
 - A pointer **"next"** to the next *Node*.

![img](images/dll-01.png)  

**See that:**

 - The **"prev"** point of the first Node is NULL.
 - The **"next"** point to the last Node is NULL.



For example, see how represents a **"Node"** *class* for a **Doubly Linked List**:


**C++:** [Node.h](src/cpp/doubly-linked-list/Node.h)
```cpp
#ifndef NODE_H_
#define NODE_H_

class Node
{
public:
    int data;
    Node *prev;
    Node *next;

    Node(int data); // Constructor prototype.
};

#endif // NODE_H_
```

**C++:** [Node.cpp](src/cpp/doubly-linked-list/Node.cpp)
```cpp
#include "Node.h"

// Constructor implementation (definition).
Node::Node(int data)
{
    this->data = data;
    this->prev = nullptr;
    this->next = nullptr;
}
```

**Python:** [Node.py](src/python/doubly-linked-list/Node.py)
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```








































<!--- ( Circular Linked List ) --->

<div id="node-class-for-cll"></div>

## "Node" class representation for a Circular Linked List

> There are generally two types of circular linked lists.

 - **Circular singly linked list.**
 - **Circular Doubly linked list.**

**Circular singly linked list:**
In a **Circular Singly Linked List**, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We traverse the circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. The circular singly linked list has no beginning or end. No null value is present in the next part of any of the nodes.

See the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/CircularSinglyLinkedList-660x172.png)  

**Circular Singly Linked Lists** are similar to *Single Linked Lists* with the exception of connecting the last node to the first node. For example, see the code below:

**C++:**
```cpp
// Initialize the Nodes.
Node first  = new Node(10);
Node second = new Node(20);
Node third  = new Node(30);
 
// Connect nodes.
first.next  = second;
second.next = third;
third.next  = first;
```

**Python:**
```python
# Initialize the Nodes.
first  = Node(3)
second = Node(5)
third  = Node(9)
 
# Connect nodes.
first.next  = second
second.next = third
third.next  = first
```

**Circular Doubly linked list:**
**Circular Doubly Linked List** has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which two consecutive elements are linked or connected by the previous and next pointer and the last node points to the first node by the next pointer and also the first node points to the last node by the previous pointer.

See the image below to understand more easily:

<div id="std-forward-list"></div>

## `std::forward_list<data-type> list-name (Dynamic Singly Linked List)` 

> **"forward_list"** in STL implements **Dynamic Singly Linked List**.

**Points to remember about *"forward_list"* container:**

 - **Advantages:**
   - Introduced from *C++11*, **forward_list** are more useful than other containers in *insertion*, *removal*, and moving operations (like sort) and allow time *constant* insertion and removal of elements.
   - It differs from the **"std::list"** by the fact that the forward list keeps track of the location of only the next element while the **"std::list"** keeps track of both the next and previous elements, thus increasing the storage space required to store each element.
   - **"Forward List"** is preferred over the **"std::list"** when only forward traversal is required (same as the singly linked list is preferred over doubly linked list) as we can save space.
 - **Disadvantages:**
   - The drawback of a **"forward_list"** is that it cannot be iterated backward and its individual elements cannot be accessed directly.

**The *"forward_list"* Abstract Data Type (ADT) is:**

 - **Insert functions:**
   - **push_front():**
     - This function is used to insert the element at the first position on forward list.
   - **emplace_front():**
     - This function is similar to the previous function but in this no copying operation occurs, the element is created directly at the memory before the first element of the forward list.
   - **insert_after():**
     - This function gives us a choice to insert elements at any position in forward list. The arguments in this function are copied at the desired position.
   - **emplace_after():**
     - This function also does the same operation as the above function but the elements are directly made without any copy operation.
 - **Remove functions:**
   - **pop_front():**
     - This function is used to delete the first element of the list.
   - **clear():**
     - This function deletes all the elements from the list.
 - **Useful functions:**
   -  **empty():**
     - This function returns true if the list is empty otherwise false.
   - **reverse():**
     - Reverses the order of the elements present in the forward_list.
   - **merge():**
     - This function is used to merge one forward list with other. If both the lists are sorted then the resultant list returned is also sorted.
   - **sort():**
     - This function is used to sort the forward list.
   - **unique():**
     - This function deletes the multiple occurrences of a number and returns a forward list with unique elements. The forward list should be sorted for this function to execute successfully.

<div id="std-list"></div>

## `std::list<data-type> list-name (Dynamic Doubly Linked List)` 

> Lists are sequence *containers* that *allow non-contiguous memory allocation*.

**Points to remember about *"List"* container:**

 - It is generally implemented using a **Dynamic Doubly Linked List** with traversal in both directions.
 - Faster insert and delete operation as compared to arrays and vectors:
   - Constant Time Complexity: O(1).
 - It provides only sequential access. Random Access to any middle element is not possible.
 - It is defined as a template so it is able to hold any data type.
 - It operates as an unsorted list would, which implies that by default, the list’s order is not preserved. However, there are techniques for sorting.

**The *"List"* Abstract Data Type (ADT) is:**

 - **Insert functions:**
   - **push_front():**
     - Adds a new element ‘g’ at the beginning of the list.
   - **push_back():**
     -  Adds a new element ‘g’ at the end of the list.
   - **insert():**
     - Inserts new elements in the list before the element at a specified position.
 - **Remove functions:**
   - **pop_front():**
     - Removes the first element of the list, and reduces the size of the list by 1.
   - **pop_back():**
     - Removes the last element of the list, and reduces the size of the list by 1.
   - **erase():**
     - Removes a single element or a range of elements from the list.
   - **remove():**
     - Removes all the elements from the list, which are equal to a given element.
   - **list::remove_if():**
     - Used to remove all the values from the list that correspond true to the predicate or condition given as a parameter to the function.
   - **list::clear():**
     - Clear() function is used to remove all the elements of the list container, thus making it size 0.
 - **Useful functions:**
   - **empty():**
     - Returns whether the list is *empty(1)* or *not(0)*.
   - **size():**
     - Returns the number of elements in the list.
   - **front():**
     - Returns the value of the first element in the list.
   - **back():**
     - Returns the value of the last element in the list.
   - **reverse():**
     - Reverses the list.
   - **sort():**
     - Sorts the list in increasing order.
   - **merge()**:
     - Merges two sorted lists into one.

See the test code below:

[driver_list_adt.cpp](src/stl/cpp/driver_list_adt.cpp)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

    std::cout << "List 1 after apply sort() function = ";
    showlist(mylist_one);

    return 0;

## `boost::circular_buffer<data-type> list-name(capacity) (Dynamic Circular Linked List)`

> A **circular buffer** is a container of fixed size and a **contiguous blocks of memory** with the **front and back connected**.

**NOTE:**  
To understand how it works, let's see the abstraction below...

In computer science, a **circular buffer**, **circular queue**, **cyclic buffer** or **ring buffer** is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.

A circular buffer first starts out empty and has a set length. In the diagram below is a 7-element buffer:

![img](images/circular-buffer-01.png)  

Assume that 1 is written in the center of a circular buffer (the exact starting location is not important in a circular buffer):

![img](images/circular-buffer-02.png)  

Then assume that two more elements are added to the circular buffer — 2 & 3 — which get put after 1 (que são colocados após 1):

![img](images/circular-buffer-03.png)  

If two elements are removed, the two oldest values inside of the circular buffer would be removed:

![img](images/circular-buffer-04.png)  

**NOTE:**  
This is because Circular buffers use **FIFO (first in, first out) logic**. In the example, 1 & 2 were the first to enter the circular buffer, they are the first to be removed, leaving 3 inside of the buffer.

If the buffer has 7 elements, then it is completely full:

![img](images/circular-buffer-05.png)  

**NOTE:**  
A property of the circular buffer is that when it is full and a subsequent write is performed, then it starts overwriting the oldest data.

In the current example, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4:

![img](images/circular-buffer-05-01.png)  
![img](images/circular-buffer-06.png)  

Finally, if two elements are now removed then what would be returned is not 3 & 4, but 5 & 6:

![img](images/circular-buffer-07.png)  

**NOTE:**  
This is because the 5 and 6 were the old first to be added.

Another approach to understanding how Circular Buffer works is an abstraction as a ring. For example, ses the image below:

![img](images/circular-buffer-08.png)  

A ring showing, conceptually, a circular buffer. This visually shows that the buffer has no real end and it can loop around the buffer.

**NOTE:**  
However, since memory is never physically created as a ring, a linear representation is generally used as is done below:

![img](images/circular-buffer-09.gif)  

**Points to remember about *"boost::circular_buffer"* container:**

 - **Advantages:**
 - **Disadvantages:**
   - Even though it is of constant size, you can insert as many elements you want but the elements will be overwritten if the container is full.
     - PT - Embora seja de tamanho constante, você pode inserir quantos elementos quiser, mas os elementos serão substituídos se o contêiner estiver cheio.
 - **Tips & Tricks:**
   - The circular buffer can be resized but it has to be explicitly mentioned by the user and resizing will add the extra spaces to the back of the container:
     - The address of front container never changes while the back of the container changes as it resizes.

**The *"boost::circular_buffer"* Abstract Data Type (ADT) is:**

 - **Insert functions:**
   - **push_front():**
     - Inserts an element to the front of the beginning point.
   - **push_back():**
     - Inserts an element to the back of the beginning point.
 - **Remove functions:**
   - **pop_front():**
     - Removes the element at the beginning of the container.
   - **pop_back():**
     - Removes the element at the end of the container.
 - **Useful functions:**
   - **size():**
     - Returns the numbers of elements present in the container and not the size.
   - **capacity()**
     - Returns the actual size of the container.

See the test code below:

[driver_boost_circular_buffer.cpp](src/stl/cpp/driver_boost_circular_buffer.cpp)
```cpp
#include <boost/circular_buffer.hpp>

int main(int /*argc*/, char * /*argv*/[])
{
    // Create a circular buffer with a capacity for 3 integers.
    boost::circular_buffer<int> cb(3);

    // Insert some elements into the buffer.
    cb.push_back(1);
    cb.push_back(2);
    cb.push_back(3);

    int a = cb[0]; // a == 1
    int b = cb[1]; // b == 2
    int c = cb[2]; // c == 3

    cb.push_back(4); // Overwrite 1 with 4.
    cb.push_back(5); // Overwrite 2 with 5.

    // The buffer now contains 3, 4 and 5.
    a = cb[0]; // a == 3
    b = cb[1]; // b == 4
    c = cb[2]; // c == 5

    // Elements can be popped from either the front or the back.
    cb.pop_back();  // 5 is removed.
    cb.pop_front(); // 3 is removed.

    int d = cb[0]; // d == 4

    return 0;
}
```

**INPUT:** 
```bash
g++ driver_boost_circular_buffer.cpp -o test.out && ./test.out
```

<div id="advantages-disadvantages"></div>

## Linked List: Advantages and Disadvantages

 - **General:**
   - **Advantages:**
     - Dynamic Array.
     - Ease of Insertion/Deletion.
     - Insertion at the beginning is a constant time operation and takes O(1) time:
       - As compared to arrays where inserting an element at the beginning takes **O(n)** time, where **"n"** is the number of elements in the array.
   - **Disadvantages (Drawbacks):**
     - Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node (head node):
       - So we cannot do a *binary search* with Linked Lists efficiently with its default implementation. 
     - Extra memory space for a *pointer* is required with each element of the list.
     - Not cache-friendly (Não compatível com cache):
     - Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is the locality of reference which is not there in the case of linked lists.
     - It takes a lot of time in traversing and changing the pointers.
     - Reverse traversing is not possible in singly linked lists.
     - It will be confusing when we work with pointers.
     - Direct access to an element is not possible in a linked list as in an array by index.
     - Searching for an element is costly and requires O(n) time complexity.
     - Sorting of linked lists is very complex and costly.
     - Appending an element to a linked list is a costly operation, and takes **O(n)** time, where **"n"** is the number of elements in the linked list:
       - As compared to arrays that take **O(1)** time.
